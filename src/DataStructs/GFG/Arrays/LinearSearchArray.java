/**
 * Given an array, arr of n integers, and an integer element x,
 * find whether element x is present in the array.
 * Return the index of the first occurrence of x in the array, or -1 if it doesnâ€™t exist.
 * Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4], x = 3
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: There is one test case with array as [1, 2, 3 4] and element to be searched as 3. Since 3 is present at index 2, the output is 2.
 * Input: arr[] = [10, 8, 30, 4, 5], x = 5
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: For array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the element to be searched is 5 and it is at index 4. So, the output is 4.
 * Input: arr[] = [10, 8, 30], x = 6
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: The element to be searched is 6 and its not present, so we return -1.
